#React example

This **React** example uses **Redux** for state management, **Jest** for unit testing and **Enzyme** to mount the React components, it has **Firebase** integration as a database. And it can be deployed either locally* using **Webpack** or it can be deployed to **Heroku**.

Deploying locally needs to have a .env file for the firebase API,otherwise the app wont deploy correctly, the same goes for the tests.
